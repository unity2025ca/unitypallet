However, we cannot provide a detailed accurate list of every content, as part of the fun in this experience is the element of surprise. We guarantee the value and quality of the products in proportion to the price paid."

      {
        question: "Do all products work well?",
        answer: "We examine products before offering them for sale. Most products are new or slightly used, and work well. If there are any products that don't work properly, we clarify this in the pallet description. We are committed to complete transparency regarding the condition of products."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I exchange or return the pallet after purchase?",
        answer: "Due to the nature of pallets and returned products, we don't accept exchanges or returns after sale. Therefore, we advise making sure of the desire to purchase before completing the process. In exceptional cases such as a substantial difference between the pallet description and actual content, the matter can be discussed with our customer service team."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide delivery service?",
        answer: "Yes, we provide delivery service across various regions of Saudi Arabia. The cost of delivery depends on the pallet weight and distance. We can also coordinate direct pickup from our warehouse if you prefer."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does the delivery process take?",
        answer: "The delivery process usually takes 3-7 business days, depending on your location. We ensure to keep you informed about the status of your order during the shipping process."
